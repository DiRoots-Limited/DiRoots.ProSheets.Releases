## Creating Profiles

DocRegister profiles make it easy to save your settings and reuse them later. It is also a handy way for BIM Managers to create standard rules (e.g., filename conventions) and share them across the organization.

Steps:
1. In the window header, click on the plus (+) button next to the profiles list.
2. Name the profile (give it a meaningful name because this is the name that will show up in the profiles list)
3. Choose if you want to create a profile with the default DocRegister settings, with your current settings, or import settings from an existing profile.
4. Click on the "Create" button to create the profile.

Tip for BIM Managers!  

Create the profiles in a network location to allow other users to import them.
See the "Importing Profiles" section to teach users how to pull profiles from a network location.
```

Once you have saved your profiles with the necessary practice settings, you can also add this profile as default to all teams. Follow the steps:

1. Create a profile into DocRegister.
2. Open the following location path %localappdata%\DiRoots\DocRegister\Profiles.
3. Copy the Profile file from the current location.
4. Replace it on all users' machines.

The profile will now be immediately visible to users.
